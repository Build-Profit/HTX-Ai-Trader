# HTX-Ai-Trader MVP Implementation Plan

Status: MVP vertical slice implemented and under demo hardening  
Owner: Wang Mia  
Created: 2026-06-18  
Last updated: 2026-06-23  
Scope: Backend vertical slice, static frontend console, local demo artifacts, and verification commands.

## Current Implementation Snapshot

As of 2026-06-23, the repository contains a runnable MVP path:

```text
Natural-language strategy idea
-> deterministic strategy JSON
-> HTX K-line request with cached snapshot and local fallback
-> deterministic backtest
-> rule-based risk explanation
-> simulated execution ledger
-> proof hash
-> static dashboard display
-> run artifacts
```

Implemented:

- FastAPI backend routes for strategy, market, backtest, risk, trade, proof, and demo.
- Dataclass-based domain models for strategy, market, backtest, trade, and proof.
- Template parser for the MVP dip-buy strategy.
- HTX market adapter with last-successful snapshot cache and local BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT 1h sample fallback.
- Deterministic backtest engine with fees, position sizing, take-profit, stop-loss, equity curve, and buy-and-hold comparison.
- Rule-based risk explainer grounded in backtest metrics.
- Simulated execution logs with no real exchange orders.
- SHA-256 proof hashes for strategy, backtest, execution log, and combined record.
- Static frontend console in `frontend/` wired to `/api/demo/run`.
- Tests for parser, backtest, simulator, proof hasher, and demo runner.

Remaining:

- Harden frontend layout against more browser and viewport combinations.
- Add API integration tests for FastAPI routes.
- Add explicit run instructions to the top-level README.
- Decide whether run artifacts should remain local-only or be captured as demo evidence.

## 1. Inputs Used

This plan is based on:

- `ProfitPrince_HTX_Genesis_PRD_v1.docx`
- Existing ProfitPrince single-page HTML/CSS/JS terminal prototype.
- Existing project README.
- Lessons from `HKUDS/Vibe-Trading`.
- Lessons from `marketcalls/vectorbt-backtesting-skills`.

## 2. Design Principles

We will follow practical "Linus-style" engineering principles:

1. Good data structures beat clever code.
   - Define `Strategy`, `Kline`, `BacktestResult`, `Trade`, `ExecutionLog`, and `ProofRecord` first.
   - Keep the rest of the system as transformations between these structures.

2. Kill special cases.
   - One strategy schema should serve parser, backtest, simulation, dashboard, and proof.
   - Demo Mode should use the same endpoints as normal mode, with live, cached, or sample data selected by the market loader.

3. Make errors impossible where possible.
   - Validate strategy JSON before backtesting.
   - Reject missing symbol, invalid percentages, negative capital, unsupported timeframe, and unsafe claims.

4. Small interfaces, boring modules.
   - HTTP routes stay thin.
   - Each service has one job.
   - No large "AI does everything" blob.

5. Never fake core metrics.
   - Return, win rate, drawdown, trade count, and equity curve must come from market data and deterministic rules.
   - AI can explain metrics, but cannot invent them.

6. Prefer a working vertical slice over broad incomplete features.
   - First make one complete path run from input to proof.
   - Add more templates only after the first path is stable.

7. Do not over-engineer the hackathon MVP.
   - No real-money execution in MVP.
   - No full multi-agent swarm in MVP.
   - No ZK implementation in MVP.
   - Leave clean extension points for P1/P2.

## 3. Product Target

Build a credible HTX-native AI strategy workflow:

```text
Natural-language strategy idea
-> strategy JSON
-> HTX K-line data, cached snapshot, or local fallback
-> deterministic backtest
-> AI risk explanation
-> simulated execution ledger
-> proof hash
-> dashboard display
```

The product must not claim guaranteed returns, risk-free profit, or unverifiable fixed win rates.

## 4. Lessons to Absorb

### From Vibe-Trading

- Treat every user request as a trackable research run.
- Store artifacts under a run ID.
- Keep broker / real trading disabled by default.
- Separate market loading, backtesting, reporting, execution, and memory.
- Provide stable local fallback so demos do not depend entirely on live APIs.

### From vectorbt-backtesting-skills

- Backtests must include fees and realistic assumptions.
- Compare strategy performance against buy-and-hold.
- Use templates to make natural-language parsing reliable.
- Report metrics in a format both traders and judges can understand.
- Put walk-forward validation and Monte Carlo stress tests into later phases.

## 6. Code Areas and Responsibilities

### 6.1 Frontend

Primary owner: Frontend Lead

Implemented:

- React 18 + TypeScript SPA built with Vite.
- 10 React components covering all required UI panels.
- Client-side implementations of strategy parsing, backtesting, risk, and proof (mirrors backend).
- Client-side LLM integration (OpenAI-compatible).
- Hummingbot controller config and bot management panels.
- Hardcoded sample result for preview fallback.

Keep:

- Terminal visual identity.
- Six-zone layout idea.
- K-line and dashboard presentation.

Remove or revise:

- Fixed `90.12%` win-rate claims.
- "Automatic profitable trading" wording.
- Fake on-chain certainty.
- Hardcoded market arrays as final data.

### 6.2 Backend API

Primary owner: Backend / Infra Lead

Implemented:

- FastAPI application skeleton.
- API routes for strategy, market, backtest, risk, trade, proof, and demo.
- Thin route modules with service-owned behavior.
- Local run artifact writer.

Current model implementation uses dataclasses rather than Pydantic response models. This is acceptable for the MVP, but P1 should add stricter API request and response schemas if the API becomes a public contract.

Backend rule:

```text
routes call services; services own behavior
```

### 6.3 Strategy Parser

Primary owner: Backend Lead + Strategy Lead

Implemented:

- Template-based parser for MVP.
- Rule extraction for:
  - symbol
  - timeframe
  - capital
  - entry drop percent
  - take profit percent
  - stop loss percent
  - max drawdown
  - position size
- Validation and safe defaults.

MVP does not require paid LLM integration. A deterministic parser is acceptable for demo stability. LLM integration can wrap the same schema later.

### 6.4 HTX Market Loader

Primary owner: Backend / Infra Lead

Implemented:

- `get_klines(symbol, timeframe, limit)`.
- HTX API adapter.
- Last-successful HTX snapshot cache in `backend/app/data/cache/`.
- Cache metadata for `fetchedAt`, `endpoint`, `symbol`, `timeframe`, and `count`.
- Local sample-data fallback in `backend/app/data/sample_klines/`.
- Data normalization into one `Kline` model.
- Source label: `htx_live`, `htx_cached`, or `local_sample`.

The cache is runtime state and must not overwrite committed `sample_klines/` fixtures.

### 6.5 Backtest Engine

Primary owner: Trading Engine Lead

Implemented:

- Dip-buy strategy executor.
- Fee model.
- Position sizing.
- Take-profit and stop-loss handling.
- Equity curve.
- Trade list.
- Buy-and-hold benchmark.
- Metrics:
  - total return
  - win rate
  - max drawdown
  - trade count
  - P/L ratio

Important constraint:

The backtest engine must be deterministic and testable without network access.

### 6.6 Risk Explainer

Primary owner: Strategy / QA Lead + Backend Lead

Implemented:

- Rule-based risk summary first.
- Optional LLM-generated language later.
- Output structure:
  - summary
  - suitable market
  - unsuitable market
  - key risks
  - parameter suggestions
  - execution recommendation

AI explanation must be grounded in backtest metrics.

### 6.7 Simulated Trading Engine

Primary owner: Trading Engine Lead

Implemented:

- Mock order creation.
- Mock fill.
- Position state.
- Take-profit trigger.
- Stop-loss trigger.
- Manual stop.
- JSON execution log.

No real funds, no real exchange orders in MVP.

### 6.8 Proof Hasher

Primary owner: Web3 / Proof Lead

Implemented:

- Canonical JSON serializer.
- SHA-256 hash for:
  - strategy
  - backtest
  - execution log
- Proof record with version and timestamp.
- UI-ready response.

P1 can add a testnet contract. MVP only needs local proof records.

### 6.9 Run Artifacts

Primary owner: Backend / Infra Lead

Implemented:

Every full demo run should produce:

```text
runs/<run_id>/
├── input.txt
├── strategy_v1.json
├── market_meta.json
├── backtest_v1.json
├── risk_report_v1.json
├── simulated_orders.json
└── proof.json
```

This is the audit trail learned from Vibe-Trading.

## 7. Implementation Steps

### Phase 0: Repository Hygiene

1. Keep existing README.
2. Add `.gitignore`.
3. Add frontend and backend folders.
4. Move old UI into `frontend/index.html` and split CSS/JS only if it does not slow the MVP.
5. Add sample K-line data.

Acceptance:

- Repository opens cleanly.
- No secrets committed.
- README and docs remain intact.

Status: complete.

### Phase 1: Backend Vertical Slice

1. Create FastAPI app.
2. Add `/api/strategy/parse`.
3. Add `/api/market/klines` with cached snapshot and local fallback.
4. Add `/api/backtest/run`.
5. Add `/api/proof/hash`.

Acceptance:

- One strategy can be parsed.
- One live, cached, or local sample can be backtested.
- Proof hashes are deterministic.
- Tests pass for parser, backtest, and hash.

Status: complete.

### Phase 2: Frontend Connection

1. Wire strategy input to `/api/strategy/parse`.
2. Render generated JSON.
3. Load K-lines from backend.
4. Render backtest metrics and equity curve.
5. Replace fixed claims with real metrics.

Acceptance:

- User can enter one strategy and see real backend results.
- UI still works in Demo Mode.
- No fixed win-rate claims remain in main flow.

Status: complete for the one-click demo path. Direct multi-endpoint frontend orchestration remains optional.

### Phase 3: Risk and Simulation

1. Add `/api/risk/explain`.
2. Add `/api/trade/simulate`.
3. Show risk report in dashboard.
4. Show order lifecycle and execution logs.
5. Link proof record to strategy, backtest, and logs.

Acceptance:

- Full PRD loop runs end to end.
- Execution remains simulated.
- Proof hash changes if strategy/backtest/log changes.

Status: complete for MVP.

### Phase 4: Demo Hardening

1. Add `/api/demo/run`.
2. Add one-click Demo Mode.
3. Add sample BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT scenarios.
4. Add acceptance tests.
5. Add run instructions.

Acceptance:

- Demo runs in 3-5 minutes.
- Demo works without live HTX API.
- Data source is clearly labeled.
- Judge-facing story is consistent with README.

Status: in progress.

### Phase 5: P1 Enhancements Only After MVP

1. Strategy V1 vs V2 comparison.
2. EMA crossover and RSI templates.
3. VectorBT integration.
4. QuantStats-style report.
5. Testnet proof contract.
6. Shadow Account from imported HTX trade history.

## 8. Task Assignment Map

| Area | Suggested Owner | First Deliverable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product and pitch | Product Lead | Demo story and compliance-safe wording |
| Frontend | Frontend Lead | Functional terminal UI connected to backend |
| Backend API | Backend / Infra Lead | FastAPI skeleton and API routes |
| Trading engine | Trading Engine Lead | Deterministic backtest and simulator |
| Strategy and QA | Strategy / QA Lead | Strategy templates and test cases |
| Web3 proof | Web3 / Proof Lead | Hash proof module and P1 contract plan |

## 9. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Live HTX API fails during demo | Last-successful HTX snapshot, local sample fallback, and Demo Mode |
| UI looks good but behavior is fake | Replace hardcoded metrics with backend results |
| Backtest results are questioned | Deterministic engine, visible fee assumptions, sample data |
| AI output becomes unsafe marketing | Use structured risk explainer and compliance wording |
| Scope expands too much | Finish one vertical slice before adding templates |
| Team overwrites each other's work | Use docs ownership, branches, and small commits |

## 10. Verification

Backend dependency install:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Backend tests:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m pytest
```

API server:
